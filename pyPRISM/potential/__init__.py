PRISM uses pairwise decomposed potentials to describe the interactions between
site-types. pyPRISM provides the potentials listed below.  If you have
potential that is not listed, please consider filing an `Issue
<https://github.com/usnistgov/pyPRISM/issues>`_ on GitHub, implementing the
potential, and sharing with the community. See :ref:`contribute`
for more details.
